[6df10baf-4dba-457c-9da7-114abf40f3d7][Patrick@12-03-23 16:33:56]:Good morning team! Let's get this day started. How's everyone doing?
[ef35f419-27e3-461e-b9af-316dc603d86c][Syeda@12-03-23 16:34:02]:Morning, Patrick! All good on my end. I've been working on the user authentication system. Any specific features you want me to focus on?
[8fde6884-b923-4279-abf2-7822783d9fc8][Dequan@12-03-23 16:34:06]:Hey folks! Doing well. Patrick, I've been working on the card deck logic for the game. Syeda, authentication is crucial, nice work.
[886d5573-291e-48a1-b140-af20571d2872][Shadab@12-03-23 16:34:09]:Morning team! I've been looking into the game's UI. Syeda, Dequan, any requirements or suggestions for the visuals?
[653d0b90-a270-4398-9e91-63eb990e6fb5][Patrick@12-03-23 16:34:14]:Great to hear, everyone! Syeda, make sure the authentication system supports social logins too. Dequan, any challenges with the card deck logic?
[52d5974b-5b10-4274-932a-30fe50d68cdd][Dequan@12-03-23 16:34:18]:So far, so good. I've implemented the basic deck structure. Just need to handle reshuffling and dealing based on player actions. Shadab, for the UI, let's aim for a sleek and user-friendly design. We want players to enjoy the experience.
[cda30f19-85c5-44e0-af0c-a520a73b85df][Syeda@12-03-23 16:34:22]:Got it, Patrick! I'll incorporate social logins into the authentication flow. Dequan, if you need any help with the card logic, let me know.
[ac12fc28-6506-4778-9fd8-f4bf148aecc7][Shadab@12-03-23 16:34:29]:Sure thing, Patrick. I'll focus on a clean UI with intuitive controls. Any specific color scheme or theme preferences?
[982d1961-4db1-4211-9b79-b170ea03d786][Patrick@12-03-23 16:34:35]:Let's keep it classic for nowâ€”green felt for the table, standard deck colors. And for the UI controls, simplicity is key. Players should easily understand how to play.
[89e7e45e-a452-4fec-a18a-7f22360ea064][Dequan@12-03-23 16:34:39]:Quick heads up, I might need some test data for the card deck. Syeda, can you provide some dummy user accounts for authentication testing?
[7aaba4c1-55d5-43d2-b5bf-7c22da632afc][Syeda@12-03-23 16:34:43]:Absolutely, Dequan! I'll set up a few test accounts for you.
[fdf1bfe6-b9c2-4c0e-a7ed-6ad6924d9be8][Shadab@12-03-23 16:34:48]:Patrick, any thoughts on animations for card dealing and gameplay transitions? We could add some flair to make it visually appealing.
[efea299a-378d-464b-b700-afead2daaf78][Patrick@12-03-23 16:34:52]:Good idea, Shadab! Let's not go overboard, but subtle animations can enhance the overall experience. Just ensure they don't slow down the game.
[0f833f32-9695-4a34-bc1c-8308758a8436][Dequan@12-03-23 16:34:56]:Speaking of speed, any preferences for the pace of the game? We can fine-tune the timing of card deals and player actions.
[2b8f5c32-9d7b-42e8-8654-a62e505ac0d6][Patrick@12-03-23 16:35:04]:Keep it responsive but not too rushed. Players should have enough time to make decisions. We don't want anyone feeling pressured.
[ada6ae06-0f6a-4043-a145-cf4cc7a2ead1][Syeda@12-03-23 16:35:10]:Alright, noted. I'll set up the test accounts and work on the social logins. Anything else on your end, team?
[55475703-e0ea-4246-b31a-d7a24095eb19][Shadab@12-03-23 16:35:15]:I'm good for now. Let's aim to have a playable prototype soon!
[3f59ba10-d392-4aec-9b6c-4be2bd640af3][Patrick@12-03-23 16:35:20]:Agreed! Let's reconvene later this week for a progress check. Great work, team!
