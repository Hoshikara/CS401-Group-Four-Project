[0dd0d4cd-bc42-4176-af38-39c10f30dfa5][Katrina@12-03-23 17:19:24]:Sure thing, Fnu! I'll prioritize that after I finish up the file-sharing component. Abbas, any progress on the video call integration?
[7cac9bba-5c0d-4207-b3d2-f06373b58187][Abbas@12-03-23 17:19:35]:Hey team! Video call integration is going smoothly. Jon, I'll need your expertise for the backend API. Mind coordinating with me on that?

[5ef714c1-a8e1-49e2-a3e1-4169d43ab5e9][Katrina@12-03-23 17:19:51]:Sounds like a plan, Tommy! Fnu, I'll make sure the notifications work seamlessly with the chat feature.  
[89e91bb5-c6d4-4b4c-ad12-0ace48a78edd][Abbas@12-03-23 17:19:56]:Quick question, team. Any preferences on the video call UI? Should we go for a minimalistic approach or something more feature-rich?
[dd47bde9-352a-4145-9fda-530d9b730b70][Jon@12-03-23 17:20:02]:I'd lean towards minimalistic, Abbas. We want the interface to be user-friendly and not overwhelming.
[dcbf193a-27be-440a-9033-fcaeca344e3a][Fnu@12-03-23 17:20:06]:Agreed. A clean and intuitive UI is essential for the chat feature too. Tommy, any specific design guidelines we should follow?
[ce142106-9cce-4bd2-a6e2-e65e9d4aa3f2][Tommy@12-03-23 17:20:13]:Keep it in line with our company brandingâ€”simple, professional, and easy on the eyes. Abbas, after you sync with Jon, let's discuss the video call UI details.
[56341b2c-ed0a-4da9-bc6a-2f11c5c9a749][Abbas@12-03-23 17:20:19]:Will do, Tommy! I'll prepare some design mockups for our discussion.
